# This is Test Project authord by Zain Arif

I've built the whole page among the provided design by using tailwind css.

## Usage
Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build or watch the CSS file:

```bash
# Build once
npm run build

# Watch for changes
npm run watch
```
This will watch the `src/input.css` file and build it to `css/style.css`, which will be your final CSS file.
